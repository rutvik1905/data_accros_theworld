Trying to gather data related to air quality, population growth, noise levels and more. 
### **About the Dataset**:
Name: air_quality_health_data.csv
Purpose: Analyze the relationship between air quality and public health outcomes.
**Key Applications:**
Identifying trends in air pollution.
Assessing the impact of air quality on respiratory and cardiovascular health.
Supporting policy-making to improve environmental health standards.
**Potential Columns (depending on dataset structure):**
Date/Time: Specific dates or time periods for air quality measurements.
Location: Geographic data such as city, region, or coordinates.
**Air Quality Metrics:**
Pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3).
Air Quality Index (AQI) values.
Weather Conditions: Temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
**Health Indicators:**
Hospital admissions related to respiratory or cardiovascular issues.
Mortality rates due to pollution-related diseases.
Recorded cases of asthma or other chronic conditions.
**Project Goals:**
Data Visualization: Create graphs or heatmaps to highlight pollution patterns.
Trend Analysis: Evaluate how air quality changes over time and its correlation with health outcomes.
Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict health risks based on air quality metrics.
**Tools & Technologies:**
Languages: Python, R, or SQL.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow.
Potential Integration: APIs for real-time air quality data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, EPA).
